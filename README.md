A simple web app in html5 and js to track the approximate location of the device transmitting.

**How to use**
Enter your name in the bottom bar, then the email address of the person you'd like to share your location with. Keep the app up in the browser and watch yourself track across the map. What you see is what the recipeint sees. That's all!

**A few 'gotchas'**
- device must not go to sleep
- device must stay on the web page after sending out and initializing the transmission of coordinates
- will not work in background

***Why?***
No reason other than to get acquainted with the html5 geolocation spec and to observe real-world accuracy from multiple devices via the web api.

Think it's kind of interesting? Let me know! [@chris_dickow][2]
